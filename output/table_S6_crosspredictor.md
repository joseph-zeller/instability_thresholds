Table S6. Cross-Predictor Convergence of Instability Thresholds
--------------------------------------------------------------
Correlation (η-ratio vs SPC1)                 | 0.275
Collapse label: percent agreement             | 100.0
Joint high-stress polities (≥90th pct)        | 5.0
Overlap of high-stress sets                   | 25.0
AUC (η-ratio, shared sample)                  | 0.694
AUC (SPC1, shared sample)                     | 0.725
--------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
– Computed on the polity subset where both η-ratio and SPC1 are available.
– High-stress = ≥90th percentile within each predictor.
– Overlap quantifies whether η-ratio and SPC1 flag the same high-risk cases.
– AUC values reflect discrimination on the merged sample.
